#### Telegram bot “Grateful Bot”
Telegram bot “Grateful Bot” is a self-reflexive gratitude practice tool in the mental health sphere (@projectgratefulbot). It mainly promotes the habit of being grateful by allowing to type gratitude notes plus archive them. Moreover, bot is able to remind users about doing practice and send the last five grates. My favourite feature is that bot can support users by listing motivating phrases, reporting on achievements in voice or text messages format. Plus, the last developed capability provides an opportunity to receive or share inspiration for doing practice with all other users!

#### Telegram channel “Edulix - Delayed content”
Telegram channel “Edulix - Delayed content” with self-development content like pop-science lectures, interviews. Telegram bot as admin in this channel downloads video from YouTube that I give its, automatically detects human speech in video, cuts silence parts and pauses in a person's speech (parts without voice activity), and then sends to Telegram channel video and audioline with the hashtag of author’s name. This is my content consuming tool.
